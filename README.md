# Introduction

## Short Blurb

Catalyst serves to facilitate the process of commissioning through a simple, unified, and mobile-friendly way for artists to easily list their prices, recieve and track commissions, and much more.

## What Sets us Apart

We are aware that there are many current and planned competitors to us.  However, we plan to provide an excellent service in a way no one else does with some of the following features:

* Easy to search system
* Responsive, mobile-friendly interface
* Messages on various events such as opening of commissions
* Message delivery to E-Mail
* **No social media aspect** - this allows for us to focus on what matters and cut the crap
* Easy integration with other social networks
* Character management
* No fees
* And much more!
