# Introduction

## Short Blurb

Catalyst served to facilitate the process of commissioning through a simple, unified, and mobile-friendly way for artists to easily list their prices, receive and track commissions, and much more.

## What Sets us Apart

We are aware that there are many current and planned competitors to us.  However, we plan to provide an excellent service in a way no one else does with some of the following features:

* Easy to search system
* Responsive, mobile-friendly interface

* Message delivery to E-Mail
* **No social media aspect** - this allows for us to focus on what matters and cut the crap
* Easy integration with other social networks

* No fees
* And much more!

# Additional Features

See our [Trello](https://trello.com/b/X37KEv4A/catalyst) for a general idea!  However, we now use [Conveyor](https://conveyor.com) for real management so the Trello may be inconsistent, inaccurate, or otherwise outdated.

# Developer Notes

This project adheres to PSR-1 and PSR-2 with the following exceptions:
- Indentation is a tab, not spaces,
- Opening braces go on the same line, and
- Closure `function` keywords must not have a space following them.
