(blocked):


I. General Terms

Please be professional and polite when contacting me for any reason regarding commissions. 
Be prepared to provide clean references of your character(s), or be able to provide a detailed description of them. 
Harassment, rudeness, or any other ill behavior may result in your commission being cancelled, and a refund will not be issued.
Follow all rules provided within my journals, YCH or adoptable deviations.
I have a right to decline a commission for any reason, including you not following the rules provided by me.



II. Payment

All payments must be made in full upfront.
The only currencies accepted are DeviantART Points:points: and USD.
Points will only be accepted via the Commission Widget, unless stated otherwise. USD will be accepted via PayPal.



III. Process

Work In Progress (WIP) will only be given if the commissioner personally asks for it.
I will also provide WIPs if I need to clarify something with the commission.

Most commissions will not take more than a couple weeks. However, the completion time depends on many factors, including:
Health, order of commission, complexity, work, school, or family issues.

If any of the things stated above occurs, you will be notified ASAP.



IV. Customer Satisfaction

I will do anything to make my customers happy.
However, after a commission is completed, only small changes can be made to them.
For example, small coloring/marking mistakes.

Any large changes will come with a fee.
Examples being outfit change, background change, or anything that would require me to redraw something completely. 

If your original description/reference was not clear enough, then you are not allowed to do minor changes without a fee.
Make sure to be as clear as possible with what you're aiming for when making your order.



V. Copyright/Usage Policy

I, the artist, hold every right to the artwork produced, not the commissioner.

Therefore, I am allowed to use the copyrighted artwork to:
Promote myself within any place or site.
To display it anywhere to my liking.
Post it wherever I want.

The commissioner is allowed to:
Use the copyrighted artwork for personal use only unless agreed otherwise.
Print the art, and claim the right of their character(s) but not the drawing itself.
Use the art to promote themselves with proper credit given to the artist.

If you break the copyright infringement in any way, every right you had to the drawing will be retracted.

The following is considered copyright infringement:
Reproducing/using the copyrighted artwork commercially (meaning making profit off of it in any way)
Taking credit for the creation of the artwork.
Removing any watermarks/signatures.
Altering the artwork without my given consent.

PRIVATE COMMISSIONS CAN BE MADE, BUT WILL COME WITH A 25% FEE!



VI. Cancellation/Refund Policy

I have the right to cancel and refund the money to you for your commission at any time.
You have no right to cancel or demand a refund from the artist under any circumstances after payment is received.
If payment has not been made, the commissioner has the right to cancel the commission.

If you file a chargeback against me, your right to everything I have ever made for you will be retracted and I have the right to sell the copyrighted artwork to new buyers.*
You will be forbidden to commission me ever again.
Your name will be publicly posted everywhere as a name I want others to watch out for. 
I also have a right to file a complaint and I have a right to all of the money you have given me.

*This only applies to artwork that does not contain copyrighted characters. (Such as line art, bases, backgrounds, or scenery.)

Any statement can be bound to change if discussed with me prior to the commission.
