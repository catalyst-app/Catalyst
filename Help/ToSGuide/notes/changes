changes

noelani:
	Work In Progress (WIP) will only be given if the commissioner personally asks for it.
	I will also provide WIPs if I need to clarify something with the commission.

	I will do anything to make my customers happy.
	However, after a commission is completed, only small changes can be made to them.
	For example, small coloring/marking mistakes.

	Any large changes will come with a fee.
	Examples being outfit change, background change, or anything that would require me to redraw something completely. 

	If your original description/reference was not clear enough, then you are not allowed to do minor changes without a fee.
	Make sure to be as clear as possible with what you're aiming for when making your order.


Naahva:
	▪️  I'm not responsible for inaccuracies or for fixing a piece, if what you are requesting was not included in your description, or your ref-sheet, or if you didn't speak up during the Rough-Sketch or Lineart-Phase.


	((Now, this is very important . Trouble can often arise when clients complain about things which are wrong - since they have the updated design of their characters in their head already - but the ref sheet still wasn't updated.
	Or if they failed to mention it.
	The way I operate is that I always send a rough sketch to confirm the poses and general setting of the picture - and then again the lineart for fine-tuning details, before i start coloring.
	I expect my clients to speak up during these phases - then they can get the changes free of charge.
	Pose changes during rough sketch phase - smaller details when I sent the lineart.
	If they have approved both but want changes later on, I reserve the right to charge fees depending on how complicated / time consuming / big the change is.

	Especially if its a 'mistake' which I could not have prevented - since I had no way of telling.

	I also recommend advicing artists to send the sketches, or at least the lineart for approval - because it can save you so much trouble.
	I often see young / inexperienced artists who haven't done commissions for too long, who don't do that and then get in trouble with the client because they have to redo big parts of the picture - or they refuse and the client wants their money back.

	The only option where i would not send linearts would be a YCH - since the lineart can be seen in beforehand - and Wing-it's.

	▪️  I can and will draw from Written Reference & I will be sending WIPs.
	However, I am not at fault for things that were either not mentioned, or which deviate from how I interpeted your words.

	((There sometimes are clients who don't have a ref sheet of their sona yet - but want a picture of them anyway.
	There are artists who only work with people who have at least 1 picture for reference - and then there's artists who also work with written explanations alone.

	Sending WIPs is heavily recommended since it should prevent misunderstandings - or having to fix huge parts later on.
	And again - if things were not mentioned in the description from the start - or if a client green-lights a llineart despite there being mistakes which I can not be aware of - and then want changes later, I demand a fee.
	Since, yeah, i had no way of knowing.))

	▪️Since this is only a sketch, I will make slight adjustments if need be - but no complete redraws.

	((I guess a rough sketch could also be sent and approved first, but for sketches i personally don't bother. especially since this was a headshot sketch where there aren't things like postures are to be taken into account : D ))


hettie:
	 •​ You’ll be shown a WIP stage of your commission. Changes can only be made during this 
	 stage! 
	 -No major changes to pose! Edits to body-shape/expressions are fine. 
	 -No changes after color and shading has begun! 
	 -NOTE! You will NOT be offered any WIP's on discounted art.

stealth nachos:
	Do not under any circumstances edit the picture yourself.
	Please contact me about edits if you need them. If I forget something that was in the reference(s) provided, I will gladly change them without an extra charge.
	You may be charged for additional edits (outside of mistakes on my part) at my discretion.
