changes

noelani:
	Work In Progress (WIP) will only be given if the commissioner personally asks for it.
	I will also provide WIPs if I need to clarify something with the commission.

	I will do anything to make my customers happy.
	However, after a commission is completed, only small changes can be made to them.
	For example, small coloring/marking mistakes.

	Any large changes will come with a fee.
	Examples being outfit change, background change, or anything that would require me to redraw something completely. 

	If your original description/reference was not clear enough, then you are not allowed to do minor changes without a fee.
	Make sure to be as clear as possible with what you're aiming for when making your order.
