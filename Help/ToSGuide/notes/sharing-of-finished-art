naahva:
	▪️ I hold the rights to the produced artwork.
	You can not use or repost my art in any way, shape, or form without my permission unless you're the Commissioner.

	▪️ I may use the artwork for art collections, sale and presentation.
	If you want to make it private (I won't post it and/or  I won't use it for Sale) let me know.
	Not using it as Sales is free - but not posting it aka 'Make it Private' comes with a fee.

	((This is very important, because if an artist later on wants to sell, say, prints of something which has turned out very well - this could lead to trouble if the commissioner doesn't agree with it - since their character could be copy-righted. 

	Also, some people request NSFW art of characters which resemble them // are very dear to them -a nd they want it only for themselves and not to be on the internet - since, yeah, many sonas are representations of us (duh)
	So this is definitely a point which should be considered, too! ))

hettie:
	•​ When the artwork is finished you will be sent one larger resolution for personal use and one 
	smaller resolution for public use.
