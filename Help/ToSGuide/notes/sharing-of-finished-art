naahva:
	▪️ I hold the rights to the produced artwork.
	You can not use or repost my art in any way, shape, or form without my permission unless you're the Commissioner.

	▪️ I may use the artwork for art collections, sale and presentation.
	If you want to make it private (I won't post it and/or  I won't use it for Sale) let me know.
	Not using it as Sales is free - but not posting it aka 'Make it Private' comes with a fee.

	((This is very important, because if an artist later on wants to sell, say, prints of something which has turned out very well - this could lead to trouble if the commissioner doesn't agree with it - since their character could be copy-righted. 

	Also, some people request NSFW art of characters which resemble them // are very dear to them -a nd they want it only for themselves and not to be on the internet - since, yeah, many sonas are representations of us (duh)
	So this is definitely a point which should be considered, too! ))

hettie:
	•​ When the artwork is finished you will be sent one larger resolution for personal use and one 
	smaller resolution for public use.

stealth nachos:
	You may upload the piece to any website so long as you give credit to me in the description.
	
	I take private commissions (commissions I will not post or use for prints), but require a privacy fee of 40% to cover advertisement and possible revenue losses.
	Under no circumstances will I remove art from my gallery if the privacy fee hasn’t been paid.
	This does not give the user commercial rights, simply the right to keep the commission private or released only at their discretion.
	This does not apply to timed privacy up to a month. In the instance of a gift that you’d rather not have me post before a certain time, I do not charge the additional fee, as long as it’s within one calendar month from the time of completion.
