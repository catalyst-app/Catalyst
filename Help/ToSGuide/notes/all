(blocked):


I. General Terms

Please be professional and polite when contacting me for any reason regarding commissions. 
Be prepared to provide clean references of your character(s), or be able to provide a detailed description of them. 
Harassment, rudeness, or any other ill behavior may result in your commission being cancelled, and a refund will not be issued.
Follow all rules provided within my journals, YCH or adoptable deviations.
I have a right to decline a commission for any reason, including you not following the rules provided by me.



II. Payment

All payments must be made in full upfront.
The only currencies accepted are DeviantART Points:points: and USD.
Points will only be accepted via the Commission Widget, unless stated otherwise. USD will be accepted via PayPal.



III. Process

Work In Progress (WIP) will only be given if the commissioner personally asks for it.
I will also provide WIPs if I need to clarify something with the commission.

Most commissions will not take more than a couple weeks. However, the completion time depends on many factors, including:
Health, order of commission, complexity, work, school, or family issues.

If any of the things stated above occurs, you will be notified ASAP.



IV. Customer Satisfaction

I will do anything to make my customers happy.
However, after a commission is completed, only small changes can be made to them.
For example, small coloring/marking mistakes.

Any large changes will come with a fee.
Examples being outfit change, background change, or anything that would require me to redraw something completely. 

If your original description/reference was not clear enough, then you are not allowed to do minor changes without a fee.
Make sure to be as clear as possible with what you're aiming for when making your order.



V. Copyright/Usage Policy

I, the artist, hold every right to the artwork produced, not the commissioner.

Therefore, I am allowed to use the copyrighted artwork to:
Promote myself within any place or site.
To display it anywhere to my liking.
Post it wherever I want.

The commissioner is allowed to:
Use the copyrighted artwork for personal use only unless agreed otherwise.
Print the art, and claim the right of their character(s) but not the drawing itself.
Use the art to promote themselves with proper credit given to the artist.

If you break the copyright infringement in any way, every right you had to the drawing will be retracted.

The following is considered copyright infringement:
Reproducing/using the copyrighted artwork commercially (meaning making profit off of it in any way)
Taking credit for the creation of the artwork.
Removing any watermarks/signatures.
Altering the artwork without my given consent.

PRIVATE COMMISSIONS CAN BE MADE, BUT WILL COME WITH A 25% FEE!



VI. Cancellation/Refund Policy

I have the right to cancel and refund the money to you for your commission at any time.
You have no right to cancel or demand a refund from the artist under any circumstances after payment is received.
If payment has not been made, the commissioner has the right to cancel the commission.

If you file a chargeback against me, your right to everything I have ever made for you will be retracted and I have the right to sell the copyrighted artwork to new buyers.*
You will be forbidden to commission me ever again.
Your name will be publicly posted everywhere as a name I want others to watch out for. 
I also have a right to file a complaint and I have a right to all of the money you have given me.

*This only applies to artwork that does not contain copyrighted characters. (Such as line art, bases, backgrounds, or scenery.)

Any statement can be bound to change if discussed with me prior to the commission.

‚ñ™Ô∏è This is a digital item and won't be shipped. // This will be shipped.

(When using paypal invoices // paypal - we are required to - once the invoice was paid - list if we have either shipped, refunded - or "order processed."
If we don't do that, for paypal it will look like we received the money - but never shipped anything in return // didn't provide our service.
Now, if you list "order processed / service rendered" paypal will now it is done - but that there doesn't need to be any shipping, since its writing, digital art -etc : D
Aside to that, I always include this line in my TOS so my client knows ((they usually do anyway)) - but also, since the TOS included in the invoice are binding, it's a security net for me! : D
Of course, I edit this out when I'm doing something traditional which will be shipped - like badges, which I only ship within my country at the moment : 3 )


üå∏ üå∫ üå∏


‚ñ™Ô∏è Payment upfront - your slot is secured once I have received full payment!
In case there are other people in the queue before you, I'll let you know once your turn has come! : )

((Many artists take payment after doing their thing - but these are 90% of all artists I see getting scammed. I don't understand why some artists want to take the money AFTER doing their job - but given how artists like that exist, I think we should respect that.
However, I personally would put up an explanation // warning to all artists to at least get half the payment before starting
Like - seriously. If you check social media most artists getting scammed out of their money are artists who don't take payment up-front. it's a shame.
Since you said you wanted to write a guide / some help for artists who're building their TOS for the first time - you might wanna include this warning.))


üå∏ üå∫ üå∏


‚ñ™Ô∏è I prefer working without deadlines, for my Usual Completion Times are usually only 1-7 Days per piece.
However, if a deadline is established in beforehand, I can work with them really well.
For this Item, the deadline is.... (insert date, if deadline was established)



Now, usually I would recommend deadlines.
There is a huge ton of artists in the fandom who take months to finish their commissions because they either take on all they can get - or they just...take their sweeeeeeeeet, sweeeeeeeeeeeeeet time - or it's a combo of both.
Since I'm absolutely behind delivering my commissions within a week, I allow myself to work without deadlines - unless, as the TOS states, there needs to be one.
(Surprise birthday gift - valentine's art, yaddayadda)

So you might wanna give artists the options to:

- don't specify a deadline at all
- specify a time-frame (example: 2 to 4 weeks, or like my 1 to 7 days)
- exact deadlines they can customize themselves


üå∏ üå∫ üå∏




‚ñ™Ô∏è  I'm not responsible for inaccuracies or for fixing a piece, if what you are requesting was not included in your description, or your ref-sheet, or if you didn't speak up during the Rough-Sketch or Lineart-Phase.


((Now, this is very important . Trouble can often arise when clients complain about things which are wrong - since they have the updated design of their characters in their head already - but the ref sheet still wasn't updated.
Or if they failed to mention it.
The way I operate is that I always send a rough sketch to confirm the poses and general setting of the picture - and then again the lineart for fine-tuning details, before i start coloring.
I expect my clients to speak up during these phases - then they can get the changes free of charge.
Pose changes during rough sketch phase - smaller details when I sent the lineart.
If they have approved both but want changes later on, I reserve the right to charge fees depending on how complicated / time consuming / big the change is.

Especially if its a 'mistake' which I could not have prevented - since I had no way of telling.

Yoshi ‚Ä¢ Naahva ‚Ä¢ PrinceLumLum, [02.03.18 07:00]
I also recommend advicing artists to send the sketches, or at least the lineart for approval - because it can save you so much trouble.
I often see young / inexperienced artists who haven't done commissions for too long, who don't do that and then get in trouble with the client because they have to redo big parts of the picture - or they refuse and the client wants their money back.

The only option where i would not send linearts would be a YCH - since the lineart can be seen in beforehand - and Wing-it's.

üå∏ üå∫ üå∏

‚ñ™Ô∏è I reserve the Right to decline Commissions for any reasons.

((I guess it's not necessary since it should be a given, but I mention it regardless.))


üå∫ üå∏ üå∫ 


‚ñ™Ô∏è  I can and will draw from Written Reference & I will be sending WIPs.
However, I am not at fault for things that were either not mentioned, or which deviate from how I interpeted your words.


((There sometimes are clients who don't have a ref sheet of their sona yet - but want a picture of them anyway.
There are artists who only work with people who have at least 1 picture for reference - and then there's artists who also work with written explanations alone.

Sending WIPs is heavily recommended since it should prevent misunderstandings - or having to fix huge parts later on.
And again - if things were not mentioned in the description from the start - or if a client green-lights a llineart despite there being mistakes which I can not be aware of - and then want changes later, I demand a fee.
Since, yeah, i had no way of knowing.))


üå∫ üå∏ üå∫ 

‚ñ™Ô∏è Absolutely be polite.
Rudeness, Threats, Harassment, repeatedly asking for updates within an unreasonable time-frame, or spamming me with private messages are reasons for me to cancel your commission and issue a refund, depending on how far I already am.
Abusive behaviour is not tolerated and will lead to a cancelation & a block.



((For me, this is an absolute must. I am a shy, soft person who hates conflict - thus I demand my clients to be polite. they don't have to shower me with praise - but... basic humand decency, n such.
I don't want people to get snarky, or overly sarcastic with me.
Given how rude some people can be, something like this would be a great option for the pre-built TOS.
Especially the sections of "not repeatedly asking for updates within unreasonable time-frames"
and maybe not to be spammed with private messages.
I know artists who like to stay in touch w their clients - I personally don't often do it but don't midn some slight chatting here and there - and then, there are many artists who don't like it at all, because they are very popular, thus have tons of clients - and thus simply don't have the time, or the will to keep up with so much chit-chatting : 3))

üå∏ üå∫ üå∏


‚ñ™Ô∏è You are commissioning me for my Style, thus the Image you receive will be similar, but keep in mind that Style always changes a little with every picture.


((Pretty self-explanatory! ))

üå∏ üå∫ üå∏

((My TOS are always tailored to the commission i am doing, at the moment. for example the shipped / no shipping - or deadline section.
The point below was from a sketch-commission.)


‚ñ™Ô∏èSince this is only a sketch, I will make slight adjustments if need be - but no complete redraws.


((I guess a rough sketch could also be sent and approved first, but for sketches i personally don't bother. especially since this was a headshot sketch where there aren't things like postures are to be taken into account : D ))

üå∫ üå∏ üå∫

‚ñ™Ô∏è If I cannot finish your commission due to an issue on my end, you will get a full refund.

((I recommend either this - or "a refund, in proportion to how far I got."
In case someone orders a full artwork, but I could only do the sketch - the lineart, of the flat colors, I substract the worht of how many stages are complete.
This could also be where the rights to have a different artist finish it - or not - could be distributed. ))

üå∫ üå∏ üå∫

Yoshi ‚Ä¢ Naahva ‚Ä¢ PrinceLumLum, [02.03.18 07:00]
‚ñ™Ô∏è If I find your behaviour to be absolutely unreasonable
(rudeness, threats of any kind, harassment, not being clear about what you want, demandinding things which always contradict themselves, or simply not being able to communicate in clear sentences and proper English, or German with me), there will be no refund in case I have already started.

((Very similar to the point about politeness - but still different enough for me to deserve it's on point.
The thing is, clients will often contradict themselves - or change their opinion every 20 minutes - and this all on the artist's back. Likewise, if I deem someone's language skills too bad in order to properly discuss what they want - or if I feel they cannot understand my TOS, I might turn them down. Since all of these are mistakes made by the client, I do not offer refunds on these.))

üå∏ üå∫ üå∏

Now we go to the Terms of Use - which are very important! The clearer and more detailed they are, the safer both parties are!


‚ñ™Ô∏è I hold the rights to the produced artwork.
You can not use or repost my art in any way, shape, or form without my permission unless you're the Commissioner.

üå∏ üå∫ üå∏


‚ñ™Ô∏è  The commissioner is allowed to:
Use the copyrighted artwork for personal use only.
Print the art, and claim the right of their character(s) but not the drawing itself.
Use the art to promote themselves with proper credit given to me.

- You may NOT sell the picture in any way (prints, stickers,....).
- You may NOT claim it as something created by you.

üå∫ üå∏ üå∫


‚ñ™Ô∏è I may use the artwork for art collections, sale and presentation.
If you want to make it private (I won't post it and/or  I won't use it for Sale) let me know.
Not using it as Sales is free - but not posting it aka 'Make it Private' comes with a fee.

((This is very important, because if an artist later on wants to sell, say, prints of something which has turned out very well - this could lead to trouble if the commissioner doesn't agree with it - since their character could be copy-righted. 

Also, some people request NSFW art of characters which resemble them // are very dear to them -a nd they want it only for themselves and not to be on the internet - since, yeah, many sonas are representations of us (duh)
So this is definitely a point which should be considered, too! ))


üå∏ üå∫ üå∏


‚ñ™Ô∏è These TOS might be updated in the Future
I will always send a copy of my current TOS along with my Invoice, so in case something changes inbetween the time you commissioned me - and the time I finish it - you can always look at the TOS Version we agreed on.

Thank you for commissioning me!




((Again, self-explanatory! My TOS often change based on the experiences I make - and thus I always have a general version, which i then tailor to this specific commission.
Since it's attached to the invoice, the client will always see what we have agreed on ! : D ))
