shipping

naahva:
	This is a digital item and won't be shipped.

	(When using paypal invoices // paypal - we are required to - once the invoice was paid - list if we have either shipped, refunded - or "order processed."
	If we don't do that, for paypal it will look like we received the money - but never shipped anything in return // didn't provide our service.
	Now, if you list "order processed / service rendered" paypal will now it is done - but that there doesn't need to be any shipping, since its writing, digital art -etc : D
	Aside to that, I always include this line in my TOS so my client knows ((they usually do anyway)) - but also, since the TOS included in the invoice are binding, it's a security net for me! : D
	Of course, I edit this out when I'm doing something traditional which will be shipped - like badges, which I only ship within my country at the moment : 3 )
