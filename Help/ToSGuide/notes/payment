	▪️ Payment upfront - your slot is secured once I have received full payment!
	In case there are other people in the queue before you, I'll let you know once your turn has come! : )

	((Many artists take payment after doing their thing - but these are 90% of all artists I see getting scammed. I don't understand why some artists want to take the money AFTER doing their job - but given how artists like that exist, I think we should respect that.
	However, I personally would put up an explanation // warning to all artists to at least get half the payment before starting
	Like - seriously. If you check social media most artists getting scammed out of their money are artists who don't take payment up-front. it's a shame.
	Since you said you wanted to write a guide / some help for artists who're building their TOS for the first time - you might wanna include this warning.))
