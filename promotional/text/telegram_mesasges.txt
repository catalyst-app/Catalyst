Hey, I hope you don't mind me bothering you.  I saw you in some artist groups and was wondering if I could talk with you about a new platform I'm working on that will revolutionize commissions?



I'm working on a new platform called Catalyst.  We strive to simplify the complex process of commissioning for both the artist and the customer. We allow for artists and clients to easily connect and find each other on our platform. We do this through easy listing and searching of artist's information, allowing the customer to find exactly what they want and who they want to commission. Next, we provide an easy-to-use system to track these commissions, simplifying and improving the whole process and allowing both sides to focus on what matters.

One of the most, I feel at least, important aspects of this site is that there's no commenting or similar features. Other services (like Fur Affinity) do that better - let's focus on what we are doing.

There's a ton more features like character storage (no more re-uploading refs and artists can see a plethora of art), commission tracking, **no charges, fees, or cuts**, and so much more!

If you'd like to talk more about it, feel free to ask me anything!  Information can be found at https://catalystapp.co/ , our Telegram group is @catalystapp , and Discord https://discord.gg/EECUcnT if you'd like to stay updated.



What do you think? Would you use something like this?
